# Publius.law

> Publius is an AI-native legal research and workflow platform that helps litigators and in‑house teams search, analyze, and orchestrate complex legal matters across documents, dockets, and evidence.

Publius combines retrieval‑augmented legal research, e‑discovery style document review, and workflow automation into a single system of record for litigation teams. It is designed for U.S. law practices, litigation boutiques, and in‑house legal departments that need fast, explainable answers grounded in their own documents and public sources.
